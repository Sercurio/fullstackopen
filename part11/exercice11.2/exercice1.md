The application writted in typescript will have a GUI and will use the SoulSeek protocol. Concerning linting, we will use the AirBNB recommended linting. The app will be build for IOS, Android and web. For testing, we will use the jest framework and test only the principle request made to soulseek server. Looking the team size and the business layer, a cloud hosting must be sufficient. So the CI pipeline chosen is Github Actions.
